/**
 * Editor-tab icons for sight's webview viewers (data browser, SMCL
 * preview, extension-conflict help).
 *
 * `WebviewPanel.iconPath` only began honoring a `ThemeIcon` (codicon) at
 * runtime in **VSCode 1.110** (microsoft/vscode#282608, finalized Feb 2026).
 * Sight targets `engines.vscode: ^1.75.0`, and on older hosts the *only* way
 * to set a custom tab icon is an image-file `Uri` — which we deliberately do
 * not ship. So the icon is gated on the running VSCode version: on 1.110+ the
 * panel gets its codicon; on older hosts `iconPath` is left unset and the tab
 * keeps VSCode's default page icon (a graceful no-op, never an error).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for that gate. New viewers should call
 * `applyViewerTabIcon(...)` rather than assigning `iconPath` directly, so both
 * the version guard and the type-cast below stay in one place.
